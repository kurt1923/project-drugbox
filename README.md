# project-drugbox
This is a search app used for a fire department drug box. The app has a search input that takes the first couple letter inputs and filters a drug array to find department drug information and dosages. There is a second input bar with buttons beside it that is located underneath the drug information. That search input receives a weight in pounds and converts it to kilograms and then multiplies it by the pedaitric dose. It then creates and appends a "p" below it that tells the user what the exact dosage of the drug will be. Beside those buttons is a mouseover button that lets the user hover over it and bring up department protocols related to that drugs use. Below I have a youtube video and blog post related to the building of this application. They both go over in great detail on the JS, html, css, and the db.json object I built to make the application run smoothly.
